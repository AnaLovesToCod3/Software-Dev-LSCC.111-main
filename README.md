# Software-Dev-LSCC.111 🤍

Welcome to Ana’s repo, where the code is as reliable as a weather forecast in April.

My life motto here is "Expect the unexpected” [^1]

## Code Readability:

- Bugs? Gone faster than you can say *CTRL + Z*

## Contributing:

You can submit a pull request! let's see if it breaks the build or just my expectations. 🫶

[^1]: code-wise
